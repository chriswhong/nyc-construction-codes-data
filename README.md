# nyc-construction-codes-data
directory structure and JSON data for the NYC construction codes

Created by scraping NYCDOB pdfs of the building code located [here](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/codes_and_reference_materials/2014_cons_codes_table_of_contents.shtml)

node.js-based scraper is [here](https://github.com/chriswhong/nyc-construction-codes-scraper).

Eventually, this will be a nice UI for the code like [dccode.org/simple](http://dccode.org/simple)
