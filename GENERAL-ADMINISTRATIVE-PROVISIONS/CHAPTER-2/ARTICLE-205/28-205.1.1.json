In such actions or\n   proceedings, the city may apply for restraining orders, preliminary injunctions or other provisional remedies, with or without\n   notice; and no undertakings shall be required as a condition to the granting or issuing of any such order, injunction or remedy, or\n   by reason thereof. No court shall lose jurisdiction of any action or proceeding hereunder by reason of a plea that the title to real\n   estate is involved if the object of the action is to recover a penalty for the violation of any of the provisions of this code.\n     "
