Such lien\n   shall have a priority over all other liens and encumbrances except for the lien of taxes and assessments. However, no lien created\n   pursuant to this section 28-204.6 shall be enforced against a subsequent purchaser in good faith or mortgagee in good faith unless\n   the requirements of section 28-204.6.1 are satisfied.\n   "
