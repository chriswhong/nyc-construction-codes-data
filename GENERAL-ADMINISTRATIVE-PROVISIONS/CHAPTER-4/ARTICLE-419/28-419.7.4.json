The use of the vehicle or tools for the conduct that was the basis for the seizure of the vehicle and tools occurred without\n         the knowledge of such person, or if such person had knowledge of such use, that such person did not consent to such use\n         by doing all that could reasonably have been done to prevent such use, and that such person did not knowingly obtain such\n         interest in the vehicle or tools in order to avoid the forfeiture of such vehicle or tools, or\n      2. The conduct that was the basis for such seizure was committed by any person other than such person claiming an interest in\n         the vehicle or tools, while such property was unlawfully in the possession of a person who acquired possession thereof in\n         violation of the criminal laws of the United States or any state.\n   "
