Has at least one year of practical experience in the hoisting and rigging business within the three years prior to application;\n       2. Has knowledge of and is able to explain the risks incident to such business and precautions to be taken in connection\n           therewith; and\n       3. Has satisfactorily completed a department-approved training course of not less than thirty hours. Any person who, within\n           the three years prior to the date of the application, has successfully completed at least a thirty-hour training course need not\n           take a second thirty-hour course, provided such person can provide to the department a dated certificate as set forth in this\n           section. Such person shall, however, take a department-approved eight-hour re-certification course within three years of the\n           initial course and every three years thereafter. Successful completion of the training or re-certification course shall be\n           evidenced by a dated certificate issued by the provider of the training or re-certification course. The certificate shall\n           include such information as specified by the department by rule. The certificate, or valid wallet card version thereof, shall\n           be readily available to the commissioner upon request. Such training or recertification course shall be conducted (i)\n           pursuant to a registered New York state department of labor training program, or (ii) by a provider approved by the\n           department.\n   "
